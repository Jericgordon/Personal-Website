## Project Objective
This project has two main goals. The first is to showcase my experience as an engineer. But secondly, I've always struggled how to showcase my experience as a hiker as relevant to a career. In 2022 I hiked 2193.7 miles on the Appalachian trail. It's maybe the longest time I've spent without a laptop, and relied on my phone entirely for communication, directions, and company for many parts. I throughly tested the offline capacity of apps, as well as seeing the effect that internet has on battery life.
 
And it very much shaped me as a person. My goal for this project is to communicate both of these things, and share them.

## Instructions to build
Building this website is quite standard; simply upload to github, and follow the standard instructions for launching a page with basic HTML/CSS

## Use of AI :
I didn't really know how to go about trying to do the highlight effect on trail. ChatGTP-5 helped by walking me through how to create and use an SVG for the line effect. I also needed help with the upward scrolling of the image, but in retrospect, it was something I could have figured out. I had 2 conversations with AI about this. I've linked them below.

AI was also used to generate the body of the contact page, per the assignment
